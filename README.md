#OverflowFade
OverflowFade is a lightweight jQuery plugin that creates horizontally and vertically scrolling menus that fade their contents on scroll.

##Why OverflowScroll?
OverflowScroll is especially great for responsive websites. At smaller breakpoints, nav menus typically stack vertically, taking up valuable space. Instead, you can use OverflowScroll to allow the menu to bleed of the page. OverflowScroll automatically adds a subtle fade to the overflowing content to make it easier for the user to understand that the menu is scrollable.
